// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var foods = ["vegetables","meats","poultry"];
foods.sort();



// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.

var foods = ["vegetables","meats","poultry"];
foods[2] = "milk";
console.log(length.favoriteFoods);

var favoriteFoods = [dal, roti, chapati, rice];
function empty() {
    favoriteFoods = [];
}
console.log(favoriteFoods);


// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.

var i = favoriteFoods
for (i = 0; i < foods; i++) {
    Text +=foods[i] + "<br>"
}
console.log(foods);

// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
